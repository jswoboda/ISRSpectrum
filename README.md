##ISRSpectrum
by John Swoboda

![alt text](https://raw.github.com/jswoboda/ISRSpectrum/master/logofig.png "ISR Spectrum")
## Overview
This is a Python module to calculate an ISR spectrum  based off of Kudeki and Milla's 2011 IEEE Geophysics paper.

	Kudeki, E.; Milla, M.A., "Incoherent Scatter Spectral Theoriesâ€”Part I: A General Framework and Results for Small Magnetic Aspect Angles," Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Transactions on , vol.49, no.1, pp.315,328, Jan. 2011

The code has been written to be able to produce a spectrum with an arbitrary number of ion species with an arbitrary collsion frequency and magnetic aspect angle. The only issue is that I will now promise that the code will run quickly at magnetic aspect angles <1 degree perp to B.

## Requirements

## Installation

	 git clone https://github.com/jswoboda/ISRSpectrum.git

	 cd ISRSpectrum
	 python setup.py develop

## Code Examples

In order to create the spectrums, assuming the user installed the code, first import the ISRSpectrum class and create an instanstance of the class.

~~~python
import numpy as np
import ISRSpectrum.ISRSpectrum as ISSnew
from isrutilities.physConstants import v_Boltz, v_C_0, v_epsilon0, v_elemcharge, v_me, v_amu

ISS2 = ISSnew.ISRSpectrum(centerFrequency = 440.2*1e6, bMag = 0.4e-4, nspec=129, sampfreq=50e3,dFlag=True)

ti = 1e3
te = 1e3
Ne = 1e11
Ni = 1e11
mi = 16
Ce = np.sqrt(v_Boltz*te/v_me)
Ci = np.sqrt(v_Boltz*ti/(v_amu*mi))

datablock90 = np.array([[Ni,ti,0,1,mi,0],[Ne,te,0,1,1,0]])
(omega,specorig,rcs) = ISS2.getspec(datablock90, rcsflag = True)
~~~

Where each colum of the data block is represented as a the information for a ion/electron species. The list is in this order[density(m^-3),tempreture(K), Doppler velocity (m/s),charge in elementary charges, mass of the species in AMU, collision frequency in s^-1]. The info for the elctron species must be the last row also !

Alternatively, if you are only using the following species: O+,NO+,N2+,O2+,N+, H+, e-, a simpler interface is avalible. Using this interface quasi-neutrality is assumed so the number of positive ions and electrons are the same. The user can get spectrum in the following way.

~~~python
import ISRSpectrum.ISRSpectrum as ISSnew
ISS2 = ISSnew.ISRSpectrum(centerFrequency = 440.2*1e6, bMag = 0.4e-4, nspec=129, sampfreq=50e3,dFlag=True)

ti = 1e3
te = 1e3
Ne = 1e11
Ni = 1e11
vi = 0
species = ['0+','e-']
datablock = np.array([[Ni,ti],[Ne,te]])
(omega,specorig,rcs) = ISS2.getspecsep(datablock,species,vi,90,rcsflag = True)
~~~
