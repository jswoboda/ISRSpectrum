## ISRSpectrum
by John Swoboda

![alt text](https://raw.github.com/jswoboda/ISRSpectrum/master/logofig.png "ISR Spectrum")

## Overview
This is a Python module to calculate an incoherent scatter spectrum based off of Kudeki and Milla's 2011 IEEE Geophysics paper.

> Kudeki, E.; Milla, M.A., "Incoherent Scatter Spectral Theoriesâ€”Part I: A General Framework and Results for Small Magnetic Aspect Angles," Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Transactions on , vol.49, no.1, pp.315,328, Jan. 2011

 Like the model covered in the paper the software can calculate a spectra given, any magnetic aspect angle not perpendicular to B, any number of ion species, and the collision frequencies associated with those ion species. As the magnetic aspect angles get closer to perpendicular to B, usually &lt; 1 degree perp to B, more and more calculations are needed for the Gordeyev to converge.

## Suggestions
It is highly suggested that the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) platform be used as the package manager. All of the development and testing has been done using this package manager.
Assuming the user has installed Anaconda a [set up bash script](https://github.com/jswoboda/AnacondaEnvUtilities), which can be used in Linux or Mac environments is available.

The user can also take advantage of two different APIs to plot results using the SimISR.
The first is in Python and is called [GeoDataPython](https://github.com/jswoboda/GeoDataPython).
A MATLAB version of this API is also available called [GeoDataMATLAB](https://github.com/jswoboda/GeoDataMATLAB).

## Installation

The package can be installed through anaconda through the following command

```sh
conda install -c swoboj isrspectrum
```

The user can also download the software and install it through pip or set up tools. It is suggested the software be installed locally as it can be updated.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jswoboda/ISRSpectrum.git

cd ISRSpectrum

pip install -e .
```


## Code Examples

In order to create the spectrums, assuming the user installed the code, first import the ISRSpectrum class and create an instance of the class.

```python
import numpy as np
import ISRSpectrum.ISRSpectrum as ISSnew
from isrutilities.physConstants import v_Boltz, v_C_0, v_epsilon0, v_elemcharge, v_me, v_amu

ISS2 = ISSnew.ISRSpectrum(centerFrequency = 440.2*1e6, bMag = 0.4e-4, nspec=129, sampfreq=50e3,dFlag=True)

ti = 1e3
te = 1e3
Ne = 1e11
Ni = 1e11
mi = 16
Ce = np.sqrt(v_Boltz*te/v_me)
Ci = np.sqrt(v_Boltz*ti/(v_amu*mi))

datablock90 = np.array([[Ni,ti,0,1,mi,0],[Ne,te,0,1,1,0]])
(omega,specorig,rcs) = ISS2.getspec(datablock90, rcsflag = True)
```

Where each colum of the data block is represented as a the information for a ion/electron species. The list is in this order:

1. density(m^-3)
2. temperature(K)
3. Doppler velocity (m/s)
4. charge in elementary charges
5. mass of the species in AMU
6. collision frequency in s^-1.

The info for the electron species must be the last row also !

Alternatively, if you are only using the following species: O+,NO+,N2+,O2+,N+, H+, e-, a simpler interface is available.
Using this interface quasi-neutrality is assumed so the number of positive ions and electrons are the same.
The user can get spectrum in the following way.

```python
import ISRSpectrum.ISRSpectrum as ISSnew
ISS2 = ISSnew.ISRSpectrum(centerFrequency = 440.2*1e6, bMag = 0.4e-4, nspec=129, sampfreq=50e3,dFlag=True)

ti = 1e3
te = 1e3
Ne = 1e11
Ni = 1e11
vi = 0
species = ['0+','e-']
datablock = np.array([[Ni,ti],[Ne,te]])
(omega,specorig,rcs) = ISS2.getspecsep(datablock,species,vi,90,rcsflag = True)
```
