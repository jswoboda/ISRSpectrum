**Added:**

* Added recreation of Figure 10 from Kudeki and Milla 2011.

**Changed:**

* Default Gordeyev functions use different integration variable. This causes all of the collision rates and gyro frequencies to have to be divided by KCsqrt(2).


**Fixed:**

* Collision rate calculation for ion neutrals as the 10e10 multiplication term was not used properly.
